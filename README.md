# Algorithm Visualizer with SFML

## Overview

This project aims to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms, including Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and Heap sort, using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) technology. The implementation includes an interactive and informative showcase to improve team understanding of algorithmic processes.

## Features

- Visual representation of Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and Heap sort.
- Interactive user interface for a better understanding of algorithmic behaviors.
- Utilizes SFML for efficient multimedia rendering.
